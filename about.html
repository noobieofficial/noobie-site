                <h2>Hi, I'm <span class="me">Luca</span>, the creator of NOOBIE!</h2>
                <p>I am just a 17-year-old Italian boy with a great passion for programming.
                    I started writing code when I was only 11, driven by curiosity and the desire to create.
                    Over the years I have experimented, learned and improved one project (and a few bugs) at a time.
                    I enjoy taking on new challenges, finding creative solutions and growing a little bit every day.
                    It is because of all this that NOOBIE was born.</p>

                <h2>My vision of NOOBIE</h2>
                <p>
                    For me NOOBIE is not just a programming language, I want NOOBIE to be a concept that inspires creativity and innovation.
                    I believe that programming should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, experience or age.
                    NOOBIE is designed to be a friendly and welcoming language, perfect for those who are just starting out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to create tools that make learning to code fun and engaging while also being powerful enough to build real-world applications.

                    NOOBIE uses simple, intuitive syntax that feels natural to read and write. You don't need years of study to start creating amazing things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're building your first "Hello World" program or developing complex applications, NOOBIE grows with you.
                    It's powerful enough for serious projects but simple enough that anyone can learn it.
